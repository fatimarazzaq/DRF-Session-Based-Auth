# React Frontend and Django Rest Framework (DRF) Backend Authentication

This repository demonstrates a session-based authentication system using React for the frontend and Django Rest Framework (DRF) for the backend.

## Overview

The project implements user authentication through the following steps:

- React handles the user interface and sends requests to the backend.
- DRF manages backend routes, processes requests, and communicates with the database.
- Sessions are utilized for user authentication, storing user information upon successful login.

## Features

- User Registration: Allows users to sign up by providing necessary information.
- User Login: Enables users to log in with valid credentials.
- User Logout: Allows users to terminate their active sessions.
- Protected Routes: Certain routes are restricted to authenticated users only.
